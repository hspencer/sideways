sideways
========

This small program created with Processing creates 2 slit scan bitmaps from a single video.
The video must be a first-person road shoot so both sides (left & right) are created from the edges.


important variables
--------------------------

* **scanBorderOffset** is the sample distance from the edge
* **scanWidth** is the slice width
* **widthFactor** is the multiplier of the output width
